    <h1>What is among us?</h1>
    <p>Among Us, an online video game released in 2018, developed and released by American gaming studio InnerSloth. 
        The game takes place in a space-themed environment, where each of the players is given a role, someone is a crewmate,
         and someone is given a predetermined number of impostor roles. The purpose of crewmates is to identify, vote for, 
         and complete tasks. The purpose of the impostors is to kill the crewmates and sabotage the tasks.
   It was originally released on June 15, 2018, but then received little attention. 
   It gained popularity in 2020 as many well-known Twitch streamers and YouTuber played on it.
    Due to the popularity of the game, the sequel, Among Us 2, was announced in August 2020. 
    A month later, in September, plans were canceled and focus more on this game. </p>
    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <p>
        Among Us is a multiplayer game that can be played by 4 to 10 players.
         1-3 of the players are randomly selected by the game to be an impostor and the rest are given a crewmate role. 
         The game can be played on one of three orbits: a spaceship (The Skeld), a center building (Mira HQ), or a planet base (Polus).
         Crewmates are given tasks that must be completed in the form of mini-games. They consist of work such as reconnecting electrical cables or refueling engines. 
          Imposts are given fake tasks to merge into crewmates. 
          They are able to sabotage a system, crawl through vents, identify other imposters, and kill crewmates. 
          If a player dies, he becomes a ghost. Ghosts are able to go through walls and complete their tasks, but no one but other ghosts can see them.</p>
    <p>Crewmates win if they complete all missions before they are killed, or find and vote for all imposters. 
        To defeat the imposters, you must kill enough crewmates that the number of imposters equals the number of crewmates, or run out of countdown in sabotage.
         When the impostor sabotages,
          it either has an immediate consequence (e.g., all lights go out) or the countdown begins and the sabotage must be resolved before time runs out, 
          otherwise all crewmates will die. Tampering can be solved by players in different ways, depending on which sabotage is to be solved.</p>
          <p>If a player finds a corpse, he can report it, leading to a group discussion where players discuss who they think is the impostor. 
               In order to identify the imposters, each map has various aids, such as a security camera system in Skeld, a log at the Mira HQ headquarters, 
              and a life indicator on the Polus. If a majority vote is taken, the person selected is discarded and dies.
               Players can also convene an emergency meeting by pressing the red button in the Cafeteria. 
              Players communicate in a text chat, but can only talk during meetings, and only when they are alive, but ghosts can talk to each other at any time. 
               Although the game does not have a built-in voice chat system, players often use external programs such as Discord while playing.</p>
